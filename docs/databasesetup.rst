Common SQLAlchemy setups
========================

Flask-Restless automatically handles SQLAlchemy models defined with
`association proxies`_ and `polymorphism`_.

Association proxies
-------------------

Flask-Restless handles many-to-many relationships transparently through
association proxies. It exposes the remote table in the ``relationships``
element of a resource in the JSON document and hides the intermediate table.

For example, consider a setup where there are articles and tags in a
many-to-many relationship::

    from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, Unicode, ForeignKey
    from sqlalchemy.ext.associationproxy import association_proxy
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
    from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, backref

    Base = declarative_base()

    class Article(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'article'
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        tags = association_proxy('articletags', 'tag')

    class ArticleTag(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'articletag'
        article_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('article.id'),
                            primary_key=True)
        article = relationship(Article, backref=backref('articletags'))
        tag_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('tag.id'), primary_key=True)
        tag = relationship('Tag')

    class Tag(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'tag'
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)

Resource objects of type ``'article'`` will have ``tags`` relationship that
proxies directly to the ``Tag`` resource through the ``ArticleTag`` table:

.. sourcecode:: json

   {
     "data": {
       "id": "1",
       "type": "article",
       "relationships": {
         "tags": {
           "data": [
             {
               "id": "1",
               "type": "tag"
             },
             {
               "id": "2",
               "type": "tag"
             }
           ],
         }
       }
     }
   }

By default, the intermediate ``articletags`` relationship does not appear as a
relationship in the resource object.


Polymorphic models
------------------

Flask-Restless automatically handles polymorphic models. For single-table
inheritance, we have made some design choices we believe are reasonable.
Requests to create, update, or delete a resource must specify a ``type`` that
matches the collection name of the endpoint. This means you cannot request to
create a resource of the subclass type at the endpoint for the superclass type,
for example. On the other hand, requests to fetch a collection of objects that
have a subclass will yield a response that includes all resources of the
superclass and all resources of any subclass.

For example, consider a setup where there are employees and some employees are
managers::

    from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, Enum
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

    Base = declarative_base()

    class Employee(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'employee'
        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        type = Column(Enum('employee', 'manager'), nullable=False)
        __mapper_args__ = {
            'polymorphic_on': type,
            'polymorphic_identity': 'employee'
        }

    class Manager(Employee):
        __mapper_args__ = {
            'polymorphic_identity': 'manager'
        }

Collection name
...............

When creating an API for these models, Flask-Restless chooses the polymorphic
identity as the collection name::

    >>> from flask.ext.restless import collection_name
    >>>
    >>> manager.create_api(Employee)
    >>> manager.create_api(Manager)
    >>> collection_name(Employee)
    'employee'
    >>> collection_name(Manager)
    'manager'

Creating and updating resources
...............................

Creating a resource require the ``type`` element of the resource object in the
request to match the collection name of the endpoint::

    >>> from flask import json
    >>> import requests
    >>>
    >>> headers = {
    ...     'Accept': 'application/vnd.api+json',
    ...     'Content-Type': 'application/vnd.api+json'
    ... }
    >>> resource = {'data': {'type': 'employee'}}
    >>> data = json.dumps(resource)
    >>> response = requests.post('https://example.com/api/employee', data=data,
    ...                           headers=headers)
    >>> response.status_code
    201
    >>> resource = {'data': {'type': 'manager'}}
    >>> data = json.dumps(resource)
    >>> response = requests.post('https://example.com/api/manager', data=data,
    ...                           headers=headers)
    >>> response.status_code
    201

If the ``type`` does not match the collection name for the endpoint, the server
responds with a :http:statuscode:`409`::

    >>> resource = {'data': {'type': 'manager'}}
    >>> data = json.dumps(resource)
    >>> response = requests.post('https://example.com/api/employee', data=data,
    ...                           headers=headers)
    >>> response.status_code
    409

The same rules apply for updating resources.

Fetching resources
..................

Assume the database contains an employee with ID 1 and a manager with ID 2.
You can only fetch each individual resource at the endpoint for the exact type
of that resource::

    >>> response = requests.get('https://example.com/api/employee/1')
    >>> response.status_code
    200
    >>> response = requests.get('https://example.com/api/manager/2')
    >>> response.status_code
    200

You cannot access individual resources of the subclass at the endpoint for the
superclass::

    >>> response = requests.get('https://example.com/api/employee/2')
    >>> response.status_code
    404
    >>> response = requests.get('https://example.com/api/manager/1')
    >>> response.status_code
    404

Fetching from the superclass endpoint yields a response that includes resources
of the superclass and resources of the subclass::

    >>> response = requests.get('https://example.com/api/employee')
    >>> document = json.loads(response.data)
    >>> resources = document['data']
    >>> employee, manager = resources
    >>> employee['type']
    'employee'
    >>> employee['id']
    '1'
    >>> manager['type']
    'manager'
    >>> manager['id']
    '2'

Deleting resources
..................

Assume the database contains an employee with ID 1 and a manager with ID 2.
You can only delete from the endpoint that matches the exact type of the
resource::

    >>> response = requests.delete('https://example.com/api/employee/2')
    >>> response.status_code
    404
    >>> response = requests.delete('https://example.com/api/manager/1')
    >>> response.status_code
    404
    >>> response = requests.delete('https://example.com/api/employee/1')
    >>> response.status_code
    204
    >>> response = requests.delete('https://example.com/api/manager/2')
    >>> response.status_code
    204
